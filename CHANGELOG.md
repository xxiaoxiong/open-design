## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-12

A memory-plus-UI release: **auto-memory store** carries agent context across runs and projects, **Critique Theater advances to Phase 7** (state machine + replay) with daemon-side **Phase 6.2** artifact extraction, **HyperFrames** lands **HTML-in-Canvas** end-to-end, and the web UI gets a **top-to-bottom Designs tab redesign**, **in-context preview comments**, a **unified Media tab**, and a **tweaks palette with HSL hue-shift recoloring**. Plus **responsive design handoff** outputs, **install/uninstall skills & design systems in-app**, **HTTP 206 range requests** for video/audio, **scheduled routines** for unattended agent runs, **macOS Intel (x64) builds**, an official **Nix flake**, four new design systems (hud, loom, trading-terminal, WeChat), and an `agent-browser` skill. 107 merged PRs since 0.6.0.

### Added

#### Critique Theater
- **Phase 7 — web client state machine.** Reducer plus `useCritiqueStream` / `useCritiqueReplay` hooks so the critique UI replays cleanly and reconnects mid-run. ([#1307])
- **Phase 6.2 — daemon artifact extraction + endpoint.** Critique-tagged artifacts are extracted server-side and exposed via a dedicated endpoint. ([#1085])

#### Web / UI
- **Designs tab redesign** — cards with covers, tags, overflow menu, and multi-select. ([#1161])

- **Tweaks palette popover with HSL hue-shift recoloring** — adjust hue/saturation/lightness inline. ([#1292])
- **Responsive preview + design handoff outputs** — tablet/mobile preview auto-fit, 2025–2026 responsive viewport matrix, screen-file-first export policy, DESIGN-HANDOFF / DESIGN-MANIFEST exports for coding-tool implementation. ([#1224])
- **Thumbs-up / thumbs-down feedback widget** under completed assistant turns. ([#1308])
- **`Cmd/Ctrl+,` opens Settings** with a platform shortcut badge in the menu. ([#1173])
- **Finalize design package + Continue in CLI buttons.** ([#974])
- **Fetch models button for BYOK providers** so newly added models discover themselves on demand. ([#1034])
- Provider-model fetch results sorted alphabetically. ([#1097])
- **Collapsible MCP JSON field-mapping helper.** ([#1136])

- Sidebar tabs flush to the workspace edge with internal scrolling. ([#1038])
- Design file rename support. ([#894])

#### Daemon, agents & runtime
- **Auto-memory store with chat-protocol-aware extraction.** Agents accumulate durable context across runs and projects. ([#999])
- **Install / uninstall for skills & design systems** directly from the desktop app. ([#1003])

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-07

A minor release focused on iteration: live-data dashboards graduate to a first-class artifact category, an in-preview Inspect mode lands for per-element style tuning, the desktop launcher gets an accent color theme, Critique Theater advances to Phase 5, and Linux gains headless lifecycle support. New Qoder CLI agent, Nano Banana image provider, and Indonesian locale. 51 merged PRs since 0.4.1, accumulated across 16 beta cycles.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-05

A multi-protocol leap: Open Design now ships as an MCP server, ships Critique Theater (Design Jury) Phase 4, gains live-reload + Tweaks mode + live artifacts in the preview pane, and adds five new agent / runtime adapters. 71 merged PRs from 40+ contributors over two days. Linux AppImage packaging landed in tooling, but the stable Linux artifact is deferred from 0.4.0 while containerized release packaging is hardened.

### Added

#### MCP & agent integration
- **`od mcp` — expose Open Design as a stdio MCP server.** Coding agents in other repos (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Antigravity, Zed, Windsurf) can read files from local Open Design projects directly, including the project the user has open in the Open Design app right now. ([#399])
- **Link code folder support for agent context** — point agents at any local code folder alongside the design project. ([#455])
- Kilo CLI (ACP) agent adapter. ([#480])
- DeepSeek TUI agent adapter. ([#439])

#### Critique workflow
- **Critique Theater Phase 4** — persistence, transcript, and orchestrator. The "Design Jury" multi-panelist scoring pipeline is now end-to-end. ([#481])
- Critique Theater foundation — shared contracts and streaming v1 parser (Phases 0–2). ([#387])

#### Preview pane
- **Live-reload preview iframes** when project files change on disk. ([#409])
- **Tweaks mode for HTML previews** — element picker, pod selection, batched chat attachments. ([#513])
- URL-load HTML preview iframes by default (`?forceInline=1` opt-out). ([#384])
- **Live artifacts and Composio connector catalog.** ([#381])

#### Packaging & deployment
- **Linux x64 AppImage tooling** in `tools-pack`; stable release artifact deferred from 0.4.0 while the containerized packaging lane is hardened. ([#369])
- Optimize packaged mac artifact size. ([#424])

#### Daemon
- `OD_MEDIA_CONFIG_DIR` to relocate `media-config.json` (Nix store, immutable images, sandboxes). ([#411])

- Craft `animation-discipline` module + opt-ins on mobile-app, mobile-onboarding, gamified-app. ([#515])
